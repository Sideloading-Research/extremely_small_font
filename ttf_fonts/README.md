# Generated TTF Fonts

This directory contains the standard TrueType Font (`.ttf`) files compiled from the raw `.csv` character definitions (in the `../definitions/` directory).

These are good for user-friendly text editors. But if you want a pixel-level quality and the maximum compactness, use the `render_text.py` script.
