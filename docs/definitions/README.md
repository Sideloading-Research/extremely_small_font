# Font Definitions

This directory contains the core pixel layout definitions for the fonts in CSV format. 

These CSV files are parsed natively by the `render_text.py` script (located in `../tools/`) for 1:1 pixel rendering. They also act as the source values that `build_font.py` uses to compile standard `.ttf` files.
